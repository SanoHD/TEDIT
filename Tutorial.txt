TEDIT is written for Linux systems.
Maybe there are some errors, when using with Windows. If you get errors, contact me.

If you are using TEDIT the first time, make shure, you have these things installed:
- Python 3.7.3
Make shure, that you have these Python packages installed:
- termcolor (can be installed with >>> pip3 install termcolor)

To start TEDIT, type
    python3 tedit.py [filename]

To get the TEDIT documentation, type
    python3 tedit.py --help
or type 'help' in the TEDIT Shell.

Debian systems only:
It is easier to make tedit.py an executable.
To do so, put tedit.py as 'tedit' (without '.py') into /usr/bin/
and run 'chmod +x tedit' on it. Now, the >tedit< command should be available
from everywhere on your linux system.
